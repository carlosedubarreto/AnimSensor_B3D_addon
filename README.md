# AnimSensor_B3D_addon

This is a try to make a "one sensor" mocap addon, using a smartphone as the sensor.

The way it was built, it is using the HIMU app on android to get smartphone sensor information. (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ianovir.hyper_imu&hl=en_US&gl=US)

This addon is not finished, but it works. The way it is today is not very usefull, and I had to stop developping it as I didnt have much time to devote to it and didnt see how to solve the problem that I was facing (to make the addon work the way I was thinking)
